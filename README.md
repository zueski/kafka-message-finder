# Kafka Message finder

This program allows you to easily look at a single record header and payload values at a particular partition and offset.

## Usage
There are two major forms for use:
### Explicit form
`java -jar kafkamessagefinder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --config=connection.properties --topic=abc --partition=0 --offset=0 --count=1`
where
`--config` is the properties file to create the Kafka client with
`--topic` is the topic name for the message(s) to read from
`--partition` is the partition number to read from
`--offset` is the offset to read from
`--count` is optional and assumed to be 1
### Implict form
`java -jar kafkamessagefinder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --correlation=connection/topic/0/0 --count=1`
where
`--correlation` is a delimited string with the following fields:
1. config file name, looks in a folder called `config` in the current working directory and appends `.properties`, i.e., `config/${config name}.properties`
2. topic name to read from
3. partition number to read from 
4. offset to read from

`--count` is optional and assumed to be 1

Sample outout:
```
Î» java -jar kafkamessagefinder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --correlation=ABC/mytopic/2/4139
